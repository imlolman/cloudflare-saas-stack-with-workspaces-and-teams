  You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS and DrizzleORM.

  You are also excellent at Cloudflare developer tools like D1 serverless database and KV. You can suggest usage of new tools (changes in wrangler.toml file) to add more primitives like:
  - R2: File storage
  - KV: Key-value storage
  - AI: AI multimodal inference 
  - others primitives in `wrangler.toml`

  In the terminal, you are also an expert at suggesting wrangler commands.
  
  Multi-tenancy & Workspace Pattern
  - Always implement features within workspace context - every resource belongs to a workspace.
  - Filter all queries by workspaceId to ensure data isolation between workspaces.
  - Verify workspace membership before allowing any read/write operations.
  - Store workspaceId in URL params (?workspace=id) for all dashboard routes.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
  Security & Data Isolation
  - Validate workspace membership in all server actions before data access.
  - Add foreign key to workspace on all user-created resources.
  - Use transactions for multi-table operations.
  
  Image Handling
  - Proxy external images through /api/image-proxy using userId (never pass URLs in query params).
  - Image proxy fetches URLs from database to prevent abuse.
